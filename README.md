# yolo_object_detection_system
Real-time object detection and dataset generation system using YOLOv8 and OpenCV.
In this project, objects are identified using a live-camera feed, classification logic is used to distinguish known and unknown.
Unknown objects are then stabilized across many frames before they are automatically captured and stored for future dataset training.

# Project Features
Custom classification logic (identifying known and unknown)
Frame-based stabilization system for recurring unknown objects
Automated dataset image capture for training detection brain
OpenCV vizualization with color-coded bounding boxes and labels
Real-time object detection

# Softwares and Programming Language Used
Python Programming language
OpenCV
Ultralytics YOLOv8

# Future Improvements
A Custom-trained model on agricultural object dataset
Hardware integration (with Arduino and sensor input)
Improved object cropping and filtering logic
Confidence-based refinement for unknown object detection
